A. Creating An Install Package

	1. Build with netbeans or eclipse IDE. Run the jar file.  You may need a proper location for the DatabaseConfig.txt
	2. Create a database with any name.
	3. Run the database script against the above database.
	4. Run the jar from this location with the command 'java -jar QuestionBox.jar'

Note: make sure the lib folder is in the save directory as the jar file you are running.

B. Using Jars

This is also a sufficient step; you can use just the lib folder, 
the QuestionBox.jar, and the DatabaseConfig.txt file to create a project structure as shown below;

	1. Create a folder
		%mkdir QuestionBox
	
	2. Under the QuestionBox folder copy the following items in that folder
	
		- QuestionBox.jar
		- lib folder
		- DatabaseConfig.txt
	
NOTE: Do not forget to run the DatabaseScript.sql against your own MySQL installation; 
For phpMyAdmin users, it is easy; create database (call it questionbox), and import 
the SQL script, click go.

Please refer to your MySQL manual if you want to use the shell/commandline which is 
also easy.

	Use MySQL 5.0+

	Not tested on MySQL 6.0

	Use Java 1.5+ (tested on Java 5 and 6)

Finally, the project structure:

	++QuestionBox
	--++QuestionBox.jar
	--++Lib/
	--++DatabaseConfig.txt
