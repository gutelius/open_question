 Setup
========================
Create your own install package as desired.



Otherwise:
 1 just build with netbeans or eclipse IDE
and then run the jar file.  You may need a proper location for the DatabaseConfig.txt

2. Create a database called "QuestionBox". or anything you want.
3. Run the database script against the above database.
4. Run the jar files.

Note: make sure the lib folder is in the save directory as the jar file you are running.
