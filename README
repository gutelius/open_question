=====================
OPEN QUESTION 0.2.1
=====================

A project based on QuestionBox; it handles queries of callers on various topics; for more 
information http://www.questionbox.org/

Currently tracking all open issues at http://github.com/openquestion/Question_Box_Desktop/issues

=============
DEVELOPMENT
=============

You can pullout the source and commit changes or you can build on top of the existing source code 
and use Java's clean object oriented features to overload or override existing classes; we have
documented the class source code (you can use the jars while retaining the document hierarchy).

For a list of ideas, feature requests and things we hope to include in future releases please visit 
the wish-list at http://wiki.github.com/openquestion/Question_Box_Desktop/development-wish-list

The wish-list has a developers discussion group that can be found at http://groups.google.com/group/open-question-developers
